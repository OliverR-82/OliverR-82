- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OliverR-82, a recently-converted M365 consultant. I have some basic programming skills but am by no means a developer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things related to the M365 platform, with a specific interest for the Microsoft Power Platform (low-code, yay!).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use github, lol... Mainly I just want to be able to raise and reply to issues.
